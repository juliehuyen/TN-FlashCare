st.markdown("""FlashCare est une application qui permet de gérer les différents processus liés à l'accueil des patients dans les services d'urgence jusqu'à leur prise en charge.

## Technologies Used
For this project, you will work with the following technologies:

1. **Streamlit**: To create interactive and user-friendly web interfaces. Streamlit simplifies the process of building custom web applications with Python.

2. **Cohere**: A natural language processing (NLP) model that offers powerful capabilities for text analysis, text generation, and other NLP tasks.

3. **FastAPI**: A modern and fast web framework for building APIs with Python. It is ideal for creating performant and scalable backend services.

## Project Objectives
Each group is expected to create a functional application using the technologies mentioned above. The application should address a specific need and be accessible via a web interface.

## Project Structure
1. **Phase 1: Design** - Define the problem you want to solve with your application and design a solution using the mentioned technologies.

2. **Phase 2: Development** - Develop the application using Streamlit for the interface, Cohere for NLP processing and FastAPI for the backend.

3. **Phase 3: Deployment** - Deploy your application on a platform of your choice, ensuring it is accessible and functional.

## Resources and Support
We will provide tutorials and documentation to help you familiarize yourself with these technologies. Technical support will also be available to answer your questions throughout the project.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your application will be evaluated based on the following criteria
- Relevance and originality of the proposed solution.
- Effective or simulated integration of various technologies.
- The quality of the user interface.
- Robustness and design of the system architecture

Good luck to everyone, and may the best project win!
